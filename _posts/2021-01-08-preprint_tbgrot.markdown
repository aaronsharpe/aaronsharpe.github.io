Check out our latest preprint where we perform hyestersis loops on the magnetic state found in twisted bilayer graphene at various tilt angles. We find that at above some threshold tilt angle, the magnetic state responds to a threshold out-of-plane magnetic field indicating that the magnetism is highly anistropic. This tells us that the orbital magnetic moment is likely dominant, as it is the most obvious route for a high degree of magnetic anisotropy. As the tilt angle becomes very small (field is mostly in the plane of the sample), the story becomes much more complicated and we no longer see this clear response.
