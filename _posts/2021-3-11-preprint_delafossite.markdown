A new preprint I was involved in came just came out([https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10075](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10075)). 
In this work, we have been looking at ballistic transport in an extremely clean material: PdCoO2. We can see all sorts of strange transport signatures from the system
being both ballistic and having a hexagonal Fermi surface. The electrons will travel mostly along the facets of the Fermi surface in the limit of zero field, leading to 
anisotropy in the transport. We studied this by studying the transport through very long bars that are oriented at a specific angle relative to the crystal axis (and hence the Fermi surface). 

Code for modeling ballistic transport in a mesoscopic device can be found at [https://github.com/dgglab/ballistic_montecarlo](https://github.com/dgglab/ballistic_montecarlo)
