I am excited to announce that Rupini Kamat and my paper has been accepted to PNAS! 
When trying to form a moiré between different materials, one previously relied on aligning straight edges of exfoliated materials as a proxy for the crystallographic axes. However, for graphene and hexagonal boron nitride, these straight edges can represent either zig-zag or arm-chair termination in roughly equal proportion. This results in a 50-50 chance of improper alignment. Rupini and I set out to remove this ambiguity by directly measuring the various crystallographic axes in the problem. Check it out here: [https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2410993121](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2410993121).
