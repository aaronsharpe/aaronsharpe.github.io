Here is the latest paper to come out of the strain project I have been lucky to be a part of with Joe Finney and (now) Xiaoyu Wang. Uniaxial heterostrain can lead to a large range of densities where the Fermi surface becomes open, providing a very plausible explanation for some of the effects we [previously observed](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2118482119), like non-saturating magnetoresistance. You can check it out [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08204).
