I recently served as a referee for two exciting papers focusing on multilayer twisted graphene stacks ([1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-022-01286-2#peer-review), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-022-01287-1#peer-review)). These papers found physics reminiscent but slightly different than magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene in four- and five-layer graphene stacks with an alternating twist angle between adjacent layers. After reviewing, I was invited to write a News and Views article on the two papers. You can check it out [here](https://rdcu.be/cRbOU).
