Our preprint on magnetism in ABC-trilayer graphene aligned with hBN occuring at non-integer filling of the lattice has been published in Nano letters! You can check it out here: ([https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c03699](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c03699)). You can check out my previous post on the preprint of this paper for a brief summary.
