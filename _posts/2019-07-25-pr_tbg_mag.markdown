Here are two press releases from Stanford regarding our recent publication: [Emergent ferromagnetism near three-quarters filling in twisted bilayer graphene]((https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6453/605)).

Thanks to Stanford libraries and the Stanford Digital Repository. They host a number of great resources and helped us [post all of the data for our publication](https://purl.stanford.edu/bg095cp1548).
