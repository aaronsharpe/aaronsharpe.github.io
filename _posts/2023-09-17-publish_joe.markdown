Congrats to Xiaoyu and Joe on the acceptance of their paper to PNAS. They really have a beautiful understanding of just about every detail in the device! Check it out here: [https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2307151120](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2307151120).

When incorporating uniaxial heterostrain into the continuum model, the degeneracy of the Dirac cones and van Hove points are lifted. This leads to three Lifshitz transitions: (1) a transition from two to one Fermi pockets which we observe in quantum oscillations; (2) a transition to open orbits where we observe non-saturating magnetoresistance; and (3) a transition to hole-like pockets. 

This model also predicts that the principal axes of transport are now density-dependent! They will rotate as a function of filling for a given uniaxial strain amount and direction.
