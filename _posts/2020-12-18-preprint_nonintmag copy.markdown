Check out our latest preprint ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10075](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10075)). Up to now, all of the moiré systems that have displayed correlated behavior have done so at an integer number of carriers per moiré unit cell. It is somewhat natural to expect this given that there may be a large exchange energy favoring the system to polarize the avaliable degrees of freedom near integer filling. In this preprint, we discuss some of our recent findings of evidence of magnetism away from integer filling of the lattice. It seems that there are also some similar rumblings of evidence of correlations at non-integer fillings in other moiré systems that may also be coming out soon!
