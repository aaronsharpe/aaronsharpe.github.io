Thanks so much to everyone at UIUC for a wonderful visit, particularly my hosts, Taylor Hughes and Philip Phillips. It was a tremendous honor to receive this yearâ€™s McMillan award.  Bill was an incredible physicist and apparently quite the character.  You can read more about Bill [here](https://ws.engr.illinois.edu/sitemanager/getfile.asp?id=2951).
