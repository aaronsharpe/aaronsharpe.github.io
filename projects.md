In my spare time, I have helped several other students address specific research problems by helping them design and build custom parts for their experimental setups. If you have such a problem, please don't hesitate to reach out. Here are some of the projects I have helped with:

**[Collar to aid in consistent sample positioning in magnet field center of dilution fridge system, Goldhaber-Gordon Group](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4900822)**

[**Optical imaging box for in-situ characterization of perovskite photovoltaic device degradation (manufactured components include camera mount, fixture for light mounts, stage for sample mounting and light controller holder), Dauskardt Group**]({{ site.url }}/image_box)

[**3 point bend/flexural testing apparatus for solid-state battery electrolytes and other stretchable membrane materials, Dauskardt and Cui Groups**]({{ site.url }}/bend)
