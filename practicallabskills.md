The amount of different hardware and tools in the lab can sometimes be overwhelming. This seminar series will discuss many things you encounter in the lab: overviewing different kinds of hardware and tools, why they are designed the way they are, how to identify the best hardware or tool for your needs, why phillips is terrible, what to do if you have a stripped bolt, how to use power tools, how to make great solder joints, what to consider when you need to make custom parts, and more.
